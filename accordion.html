                <strong>Apple Inc.</strong> is an American multinational technology company that specializes in consumer electronics, computer software and online services. Apple is the world's largest technology company by revenue (totaling $274.5 billion in 2020) and, since January 2021, the world's most valuable company. As of 2021, Apple is the world's fourth-largest PC vendor by unit sales[9] and fourth-largest smartphone manufacturer.[10][11] It is one of the Big Five American information technology companies, along with Amazon, Google (Alphabet), Facebook (Meta) and Microsoft.[12][13][14]

                Apple was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne in 1976 to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. in 1977 and sales of its computers, including the Apple II, grew quickly. It went public in 1980 to instant financial success. Over the next few years, Apple shipped new computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, such as the original Macintosh, announced with the critically acclaimed advertisement "1984".
                
                The high price of its products and limited application library caused problems, as did power struggles between executives. In 1985, Wozniak departed Apple amicably,[15] while Jobs resigned to found NeXT, taking some Apple co-workers with him.[16]

Samsung entered the electronics industry in the late 1960s and the construction and shipbuilding industries in the mid-1970s; these areas would drive its subsequent growth.

Notable Samsung industrial affiliates include Samsung Electronics (the world's largest information technology company, consumer electronics maker and chipmaker measured by 2017 revenues),[5][6] Samsung Heavy Industries (the world's 2nd largest shipbuilder measured by 2010 revenues),[7] and Samsung Engineering and Samsung C&T Corporation (respectively the world's 13th and 36th largest construction companies).[8] Other notable subsidiaries include Samsung Life Insurance (the world's 14th largest life insurance company),[9] Samsung Everland (operator of Everland Resort, the oldest theme park in South Korea)[10] and Cheil Worldwide (the world's 15th largest advertising agency, as measured by 2012 revenues).[11][12]

                <strong>Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. </strong>(/ˈhwɑːweɪ/ WHAH-way; Chinese: 华为; pinyin: About this soundHuáwéi) is a Chinese multinational technology corporation headquartered in Shenzhen, Guangdong, China. It designs, develops, and sells telecommunications equipment and consumer electronics.[4]

                The corporation was founded in 1987 by Ren Zhengfei, a former Deputy Regimental Head in the People's Liberation Army.[5] Initially focused on manufacturing phone switches, Huawei has expanded its business to include building telecommunications networks, providing operational and consulting services and equipment to enterprises inside and outside of China, and manufacturing communications devices for the consumer market.[6][7] Huawei has over 194,000 employees as of December 2019.[8]
                
                Huawei has deployed its products and services in more than 170 countries and areas.[9] It overtook Ericsson in 2012 as the largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer in the world,[10] and overtook Apple in 2018 as the second-largest manufacturer of smartphones in the world, behind Samsung Electronics.[11] In 2018, Huawei reported that its annual revenue was US$108.5 billion.[12] In July 2020, Huawei surpassed Samsung and Apple to become the top smartphone brand (in number of phones shipped) in the world for the first time.[13] This was primarily due to a drop in Samsung's global sales in the second quarter of 2020, owing to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
